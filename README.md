```
As a user,
So I can see all of my bookmarks
I want to be able to see a list of my bookmarks
As a user,
When I find a website that I want to save
I want to add a new bookmark
Aa a user,
When I no longer need a bookmark
I want to be able to delete the bookmark
As a user,
When I need to make a change to a bookmark
I want to be able to update a bookmark
As a user
So that I can better understand bookmarks
I want to be able to Comment on bookmarks
As a user
So that I can see related bookmarks
I want to be able to Tag bookmarks into categories
As a user
So that I can compare related bookmarks
I want to be able to Filter bookmarks by tag
As a maintainer of the system
To protect the privacy of users
I want Users to be restricted to managing only their own bookmarks
```
